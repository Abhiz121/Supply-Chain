Working of app.py
1.	Data Loading:
o	The system loads data from a CSV file (analyzed_supply_chain_data.csv) containing tea production, supply, and demand information.
2.	Streamlit Interface:
o	Streamlit provides an interactive interface for users to manage inventory, select regions, and perform various actions like stocking or supplying materials.
3.	Inventory Management:
o	The system allows users to add incoming stock to the inventory and remove outgoing stock, adjusting the available warehouse space accordingly.
o	Each incoming or outgoing action updates the inventory status and the available space in the warehouse.
4.	Risk Alerts:
o	The system generates risk alerts based on the sentiment score from the dataset or if the available warehouse space is critically low.
o	Risk alerts are triggered if the sentiment score is below 0.50 or the available space is dangerously low.
5.	Slack Integration:
o	Alerts are sent to a Slack channel in real time via a webhook URL, notifying stakeholders of potential risks.
6.	Filtering and Reporting:
o	Users can filter the alerts by region and month to focus on specific areas of concern in the supply chain.
7.	Save Inventory:
o	The current inventory status can be saved to a new CSV file for future reference or further analysis.

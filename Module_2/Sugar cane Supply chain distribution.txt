Sugar cane Supply chain distribution model 
1. Key Components of the Sugarcane Supply Chain

    Farming and Harvesting
        Planting and nurturing sugarcane.
        Monitoring for optimal harvesting time based on maturity.

    Transportation
        Moving harvested sugarcane to mills or processing facilities.
        Managing perishable timelines, as sugarcane must be processed quickly after harvest.

    Processing and Refinement
        Extracting juice, crystallizing sugar, and refining it into consumable products.
        Managing by-products like bagasse and molasses.

    Storage and Distribution
        Storing raw or refined sugar.
        Distributing to wholesalers, retailers, and industrial customers.

    End Customers
        Delivering products like table sugar, molasses, or bioethanol.

2. Risk Factors
	
	A. Time Sensitivity - Perishables, such as sugarcane , 	deteriorate quickly after harvesting.
	B. Weather Climate Risks - Unpredictable weather, such as droughts, floods or extreme temperatures, affects crop yields, harvesting and transportation.
	C. Transportation - Inefficient or delayed transportation
	D. Quality - Perishables degrade if not processed or stored correctly.
	E. Changes in  trade policy, cost changes.
	F. Labor shortages, disputes or skill gaps
